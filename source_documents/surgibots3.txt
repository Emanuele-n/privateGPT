Hello and welcome to today's episode of the Surgery Bots podcast. In this episode
we sit down with Mike Santek. So Mike is the CEO of a company called BHS
Technologies who produce a robotic microscope for microsurgical procedures.
And in the episode we talk about various different partnerships the
company has with other surgical robots and as well as the challenges faced
through COVID, how they've emerged through these and what the future
roadmap of the business looks like. So I hope you enjoy this episode.
So hello Mike and welcome to the Surgery Bots podcast. It's a pleasure to have you here.
Thanks Henry, thanks for inviting me.
Good stuff. So for the sake of the audience can you give me a bit of a
snapshot CV and tell me about your background.
My background actually is just mechanical engineering.
So I was working in the medical device field in the meantime since I think 17
years or so and previous to that I was working two years in construction site
machinery field and then I started as a mechanical engineer, went to be a project
leader, mechanical design manager, head of R&D, head of production for active
implants and also for heart catheters. And one day we thought we got an idea
and let's found a company and that's how it went.
Okay fantastic. So the company you founded is BHS Technologies. So take me
back to the early days. Why did you decide find a company, found a company
and and yeah give me the story.
So what was the story? I mean so I was working for
a company manufacturing hearing implants and we were spending many many hours in
the lab doing research with hearing implants, middle ear implants and for
stuff like that you need a surgical microscope and I always enjoyed using
surgical microscopes being in the lab doing the research but using the system
was or these surgical microscopes it was always a bit cumbersome and but it was
okay it was the devices which were there were just fine and good for the
good for the work. Then I quit the job went to the other company doing heart
catheters and on the technological side it was I don't want to say it was boring
but it was yeah a bit a bit boring for that company was just taking some glue
some glue and some tubes and connecting that stuff and that was it. So on the
technological side I didn't enjoy it so much and one day one of my colleagues
were our former colleagues was calling me and he asked me if I could build a
digital microscope and I said yeah well maybe I have no idea. On the mechanical side
yeah sure why not because it's just a mechanical it's a machine of course I
can do that but I have no idea about digitalization about software about image
processing so I called up Gregor and he's the B in BHS and we were sitting on
my balcony having a beer or two brainstorming of how things could be
improved and not just building a digital surgical microscope but changing the
concept than this we didn't have to worry about any product portfolio or
anything like that we thought it would be a really cool idea to take a 3d
camera a robotic arm and VR headset assemble these components and here we go
it's a surgical microscope you control the robotic arm with your head movements
and camera always observes the surgical field easy task because you can buy
everything and we we'd be done within a year or within two having our class one
medical device and then we said yeah let's build the proof of concept and as
it was so promising and as we have received also the first R&D grants we
said yeah then why not quit our jobs and found a company and that was basically
the story how it came along I mean we knew that there is a that there are
surgical microscopes out there we know for what application they're used we
know that they're cumbersome and having the proof of concept was it was it was
cool from the engineering standpoint if we would have known at that time how
much work and effort it is we probably would not have done it I understand that
completely still hear that right you you were having a few beers and came up with
the concept yeah so you found it in a in a bar or were you back at home no no no
in a bar but we spent the day or the afternoon on my balcony just
brainstorming about it and I mean when you we found it out pretty early that
when you do have only a PowerPoint presentation with some fancy renderings
and an idea you are not able to raise any money and you're not able to
convince also the FFG or AWS which are having huge R&D grants in Austria and we
are super thankful for that but you cannot convince them that your product
idea which is a niche makes sense and so that's why we've decided to build a
proof-of-concept 3d printed two axis don't want to say robotic arm kind of
and which was holding two cameras and was controlled by a VR headset and with
that video of how the system moved and explaining what the problem is and how
we are going to solve the problem we got the first grants and during that time
building the proof-of-concept applying for the grants we said yeah then let's
let's found the company because they are willing to pay and now we can't be the
one saying and no no we we are out it was just an idea but we are too we are
afraid of building it we are too afraid of founding the company and that was a
period of about four or five months or so and yeah after that we found the
company fantastic so I actually test drove the robotic scope out of health
and that's where we met and although I'm winning no prizes for micro surgeon the
year it was quite easy for me to pick it up and so it's a non-invasive robot it's
a visualization system really but so let's for the audience can you build a
picture of what the robotic scope actually is and what it does it is
actually exactly what you've explained it is a it's a non-invasive device for
visual visualization so we do it's a surgical microscope so we do only
observe the the surgical field a 3d camera records that and transfers that
image to our head mounted display and with the head mounted display where you
get the microscopic view you are able to control the system like changing the
viewing angle moving the point of view changing the level of magnification
stuff like that so we are just observing with our device the procedure the
surgical procedure and the surgeon does the surgical procedure as he did it or
she did all the time and we do only change the ergonomics and a bit of the
workflow as you don't have to put down the instruments to control the system
because you can do all of that with your head okay so so what procedures can
it be used for them for example for your surgery mastoid surgery middle ear
implants in the ear implants cochlear implants to endoplasties also for spine
surgeries disc herniations plastic surgery flap transplantations for
example or hand surgery every time when you got very small structures but you
need open surgery and cannot use for example DaVinci or CMR system that's
another league that's another discipline so every time you get an open surgery
and you need a high magnification then you are going to use a surgical
microscope and you can either choose that an old or standard system analog
one whatever or you choose robotic scope and benefit from all the advantages we
are having okay so tell me about some of those advantages there so what we are
changing is especially the ergonomics for using a surgical microscope so what
the science says or what the data says is that four out of five surgeons do
have back problems so depending on the on the on the paper you're reading it's
between 60 and 87 percent or something like that complain that they do have
back problems and that's associated with just three hours of microscope usage in
the OR so it's a so you basically do one procedure per week and your back is
feeling bad and that's what we change because we detach the surgeon from the
surgical microscope or from the from the device itself as you were only they had
another display stay in an ergonomic posture but not in an static ergonomic
posture like with a typical or with a standard surgical microscope but you can
say dynamic we can stand you can relax your neck where HMD is which is super
lightweight and with that system that the whole issue is solved that you have
to adapt to the surgical microscope stay in a weird ergonomic or unhealthy
posture for a couple of hours multiple times a week and that's that's the main
thing we are solving and also speaking about or you could of course use another
system an exoscope where 3d screen is used in or set up in the OR but as we
all know here is that ORs are typically not so huge finding the place for one
3d screen or for a second one for the assistant it's not very easy and when
you wear a HMD the displays head mounted so you don't have to worry about
where to place that screen you need to have the perpendicular view that you
that get the depth impression the 3d view and these are all things you don't
have to worry about with our system so that's what what we are changing there
awesome so how many of your systems are out on the market at the minute in use
it's we're getting to the about 50 devices distributed sold worldwide of
course the number is changing so what what markets are you in so far we do
have distributors who are active in about 45 countries which is quite quite
a lot especially when you also consider that we had COVID when we launched a
product and also in the years after and but but still we we had distributors who
were still able to move forward and do some trials and we were also able to to
to gain knowledge of how the device has been used in the OR and these
distributors are in Central East Europe in Western Europe we are in in the
Middle East also in Australia and South Korea in the United States and so that's
that's approximately about it so you mentioned one and one key thing there
about COVID how did that affect business COVID was I mean it was for us it was it
was just horrible I mean so we founded the company in 2017 we had our business
plan we knew how long development takes how many years we we knew we had to
launch the product in 2020 because you got the business plan you got the cash
for plan and then there was COVID we were launching in middle of the
pandemic we were launching in June 2020 and we had about two three four months
where life was okay also after launching the product but then autumn came COVID
numbers were picking up we had some policies or some regulations in basically
all over Europe and the United States which said we are not allowed to go into
the hospital anymore to demo our product and that was almost two years where we
went when we and also our distributors were not or hardly able to sell
something and that gave us a really hard time that that was just horrible and if
we would have known that something like that would happen we would
have had another plan but I mean these are things it just come unexpected well
it definitely came unexpected I was living out in Austria at the time that
COVID hit I was living in St. Anton which is just up the valley from Innsbruck
which is where you're based and I know we managed to get a flight out as soon
as it hit and we were told by the police to get out actually of our mental
department but the COVID rules I'd heard how strict they were so you've got all
the sales staff around the world that were affected but how did it affect
central operations in Innsbruck? The central operations in Innsbruck was I
mean we as it was quiet I mean production was was not ramping up so
that was quiet R&D was super focused because there was no there were no sales
team coming from the market and putting in feature requests and stuff like that
so they were super or they were able to focus on the device improving it getting
or implementing feedback from the first customers and making it even more ready
for the OR so that was a good situation definitely we were asking all the people
who were able to do home office but just to protect manufacturing because
manufacturing they can't do home office as we are manufacturing also the zoom
lenses internally and the head mounted display so we need the clean room and
stuff like that so that that was the biggest impact but even after four or
five six weeks staff was asking us or if they may come back to the office because
they are just alone at home not having the possibilities to do home office it's
still home and not office and so on so we decided to leave everyone back to the
office and yeah get at least a little social life yeah absolutely I mean when
I flew back to the UK it was a completely different story to what had
just gone on in Austria it was quite a strange situation but then everything
closed down so and a lot of my friends who were left in Austria I know they
struggled a lot more than a lot more than it sounds like your guys did six
weeks and back in the office there was yeah we we missed we are the in Tirol we
missed some things or the politicians but it's something I don't want to jump
in here because there will be an ever ending story yeah let's keep on with the
the surgical robotics side of politics and so yeah some of some of the
partnerships that you guys do at BHS are really interesting because it brings
together robotics plus robotics and there's collaborations with medical
micro instruments and collaboration with Microsoft so talk to me a little bit
about what those two are. Microsoft is more ergonomics focused and NMI I can't remember what the name of the study was. Tell me more about those two.
So it was never a strategic plan to put something like that up like the
cooperation or the installation we are having in the Münster Fachklinik für
Plastische Chirurgie Hohenheide so it's a plastic department in Münster with
Professor Küchlerhaus and he actually was the one who applied for a EU grant I
think it was to combine both systems it's going to the direction of
digitalization of the OR or of the future something like that so he came up
with that idea of course we were supporting it and both of us MMI and we
were super lucky that that grant got approved and then he was able to
purchase both devices and that was I think first time in the world when two
surgical robots were combined just by one surgeon or one surgeon is the
interface for both systems because he's wearing our head-mounted display
controlling our device and holding in his hands the instruments from MMI and
controlling the second surgical robot and in the meantime he did plenty of
surgeries and it's for him it's like it's standard state-of-the-art
performing the surgeries in that way it's it's a joy watching that and so
that's the thing with MMI plastic surgery doing some super
micro-anastomosis and micro-surgery it's basically the same but just another
surgical robot. For us, for BHS, it doesn't change
anything if we go with MMI or combine our device with MMI or with the
micro-surgery system and I can't explain all the differences between MMI and
micro-surgery I'm not that much into the detail of these two systems but for us
it's a really it's a joy having such installations because we never thought
about it that something like that will happen we always thought it's gonna be
super cool if that could happen and then all of a sudden it was
just there so the future has arrived. Cool, so actually I think one thing we
haven't really touched on so far is we know that it's a digital microscope but
actually the controls of it is hands-free I think that's what the real
unique part of it is so tell us a bit more about the interface and how the
surgeon actually controls the system. It's pretty simple but making it pretty
simple that it's I think that's that's the art so you get one foot switch which
is just one single button not a complicated foot pedal and I mean having
a foot switch in the OR it's pretty common as you get the bipolars you get
the power tools and so on so the surgeon has that one foot switch he presses that
foot switch and in the head-mounted display a user interface is popping up
it's a super super simple very intuitive and with your head movements
you control a cursor like with your hand the mouse cursor and so by controlling
the cursor you select one of the functions go back to the center to
confirm it and as long as you press the foot switch that function stays
activated and then it's everything what you can do is based on what you see so
for one function for example it's we call it free view that's when you move
to point of interest to somewheres and explore the surgical field you see the
image you move your head to the left and the image moves to the right it's like
it's like in real world but a robot controls the movement or these small and
tiny movements so super simple to use. Indeed indeed and that's why I was so
able to pick it up within about five to ten minutes of actually using the
system I was able to control it and I'm obviously not a surgeon so it's
definitely intuitive to use. So going back to the the collaborations then can
you plug into for example NMI's sales team or can you plug into I know
Microsoft's not quite at the stage of market yet but can you plug into those
sales teams and sell them as a combination product now? Yeah sure sure
and also NMI has put up a OR solution as they call it also included our
device for their OR solutions also being able to demonstrate how our how
their system could be used of course the customers surgeons who don't like
wearing a head-mounted display or who are in favor with the Olympus
Orbi or something like that so fair enough they can also use these systems
but we are also part of their OR solutions which makes us pretty proud
and it's also the other way around this as we do have distributors but also
doctors who are asking or who know that installation from von Heide from
Professor Küchlehaus and who are asking for for getting the contact to NMI
because they also want to see that set up and just yeah are being stoked.
And that's the collaboration so there's nothing very specific or
special on that because also for NMI and Microsoft probably in the future
they also don't want to lock into one microscope vendor because it doesn't
make any sense for them thinking if some surgeon has already bought a brand
new whatever exoscope and doesn't need a robotics scope anymore then he should
not buy a robotics scope or have to buy it.
Exactly and I suppose it works both ways as well you don't want to just tie up to
one robotics company when there's so many emerging companies coming out that
you could use your scope with.
Yeah right right same for us.
So moving on to more questions about the business then the business side so how
have you funded the business up to this point we've talked about a couple of
grants but any other ways of funding?
We do have pretty good R&D grants high-tech especially high-tech deep
tech med tech in Austria so that's definitely worth applying for those and
FFG and AWS did a fantastic job with these grants and that's always for R&D
or for the R&D part you need a co-financing or you need co-financing
and for that in the early days we were using our own money and then doing some
side projects like engineering and consulting stuff and afterwards of
course you're gonna start fundraising searching for an investor and that's or
that investor they did the co-financing part to the to the R&D grants and
they're with with us since 2018 super super good to work with them and that's
that's how we were funding the business and how would do you plan to fund the
business into the future? The ideal case of course will be just by the revenue we
are making but we know that we have to speed up here and there some things and
when you want to speed up you need a second series and that's that's the part
or that's the plan for now just to raise another round growth capital and just to
stay ahead of the others we're playing with similar technologies and then of
course we're going we are getting or will be getting fingers crossed to that
point where it's just all based on revenue. Fantastic so you said there's a
couple of people producing like developing similar technologies who who
are some of those players? So I can't tell you all the things because they
might be confidential but as you can imagine I mean there the digital
surgical microscopes out there there are companies also having robotic surgical
microscopes like the S-Colab EOS for example or Synaptive Modus V and for
them it's in my point of view a logical next step also to come up with a head
mounted display also also Zeiss has presented at the Kurok in Germany that
they also think that head mounted displays will be the future and not 3d
screens in the OR and so I think it's just a logical next step for many of
them to get rid of the eyepieces get rid of the huge 3d screens you know these
85 inch whatever Sony TVs and also develop their own HMD and do stuff with
their HMDs but that's something I don't know also and maybe I'm that the things
I know I'm not allowed to tell. That's understood understood we'll trip
carefully. So historically what have been some of the biggest challenges that
you faced as a business? Historically the biggest challenges I'd say it was Covid
definitely because that that killed our complete plan. Covid was yeah that was a
big challenge because having having the plan which which worked so well and then
having that impact what that that was a big showstopper and then of course
afterwards everything which is related to changing the strategy changing the
plan that's that's a big challenge and also another challenge was and that's
something we or no one should neglect or ignore is to develop an organization
which is ready to be scaled but still stays efficient and so we went from 2017
in February we were three of us four of us and when Covid started or mid 2020
we were about 50 people and scaling so fast and having to move the office like
two times a year and but still also documenting the processes onboarding
people integrating people that's a big really big challenge but I think we
managed it very good but we do also have an excellent team so thanks thanks to
everyone who is listening from the team and did everyone a fantastic job and
yeah these two things I'd say were the biggest ones. Okay and in present day
then what do you see as either the the challenges now or the challenges that
you're going to have to overcome in in the next couple of years. Implementing a
disruptive technology that's always gonna be a challenge but it's also the
fun part of founding a new company and developing something like that so that
that's that's gonna be there and we are still in the niche and need to expand
that niche day by day then the fundraising also with the with the
current situation with economy Ukraine Russia war it's all I think there were
better times so these that's also kind of challenging we don't worry about
supply chains because that's something we we set up very well so yeah nothing
to worry about here we don't worry about the MDR because we were working
according to the MDR since day one so actually the challenges on that so we
are not not afraid of them. So you have the robotic scope that's currently out
on the market is being sold I know that you do a surgical drape but what else is
in the innovation pipeline or what other supplementary products are you looking to
develop? I can't tell you our R&D pipeline but what I can say for sure is
that the robotics scope that's a huge playground to develop more stuff the
drape it's just a drape it's not nothing really fancy also for developers and but
but the robotics scope itself as it's you could say it 50% of it is hardware
and 50% is software and with the hardware we are having and also with the
system architecture we are able to integrate other or more information we
do have a very powerful computer very powerful GPU so there's a lot of
processing power in the device and especially the software side it's
it's a huge playground for our R&D team where we can enable other things like
also AR or getting into the direction of AI in the future connecting other
device like surgical navigation also integrating stuff like that it's it's
really cool and it's also just an obvious next step or also being able to
control other devices but I mean that's getting more into the direction which I
have not allowed to tell today but I said it's it's a huge playground and the
robotics scope as it is today works as a surgical microscope but development as
we all know never stops and after the first and second generation there will
be a third one and maybe also some complementary products which are being
used with robotics scope or we what we also did is to just take the HMD itself
because it's also a device can be a medical device connect to that to an
endoscope and use it for endoscopic procedures because in the endoscopic
procedures you you get the same issues with ergonomics and being able to see
the screen and so on so you even something that that could happen in the
in the in the future that we are just taking pieces of our technology and use
that for other devices either standalone or in combination with something else
so five years down the line what's your vision for the business what's the high
level vision that's a good question that's a good question five five years
down the line from today on I I so that the division or the big idea is that we
grow further that we do have a reasonable amount of revenue we see many
robotic scopes being used on the daily basis in the ORs and this would be just
a consequence because of that that the robotics scope got more of a mainstream
product and it's common using a HMD within a surgical microscope so that's
that's the that's division so to move from the niche product which has the
sweet spot for some surgical procedures to the mainstream product being used for
every surgical procedure or for every microsurgical procedure and then what I
said previously regarding revenue and so on and growth that's just the logic
consequence okay and so at the minute you said 45 distributors and a
registered so are you planning to grow through distributorships or were you
planning to build a direct sales force as well we got a go with distributors
because especially as you know hiring people it's hard and employing your own
sales force for all the countries it's super expensive and I think we would not
been able to once I'd afford it and on the other side also to manage so many
teams and grow so fast as we can with distributors and the other thing is when
you don't have the contacts in the countries or know the Ministry of Health
or know how the procedures are and don't know who the people are who have all the
connections it's super super hard to build up a team and sell a product that's
why we we prefer evaluating our distributors having a close partnership
and let them participate also on the device and we also participate on their
knowledge and connections. Okay do they come with any challenges to grow
through distributorships that maybe you wouldn't with it a direct sales force
yeah I think it's more or less the same challenge or kind of the
same challenge because when you build up a sales team or any team and you hire
people you can hire the wrong people and you find that out later maybe a year
later that they are not performing so well you have to take the difficult
decisions redo some things and with distributors it's gonna be actually the
same of course when you sell through distributors the margin is lower you
also have to educate them but there is no costs directly with running them and
that's in our stage for our plan the way easier one than hiring directly of
course we do have direct sales in Austria Germany and also restarting the
business in the United States because we also need to learn how you can sell at
the device and then partner up with our distributors and find or hear their
thoughts and develop the best way to sell it. Okay and so you mentioned a couple of key
geographies there obviously you've got direct in a couple of locations you're
looking to launch the US again are you planning to take on some of the some of
the markets outside Europe in the US are you looking towards Asia the Middle East
Africa? Yeah sure as a Middle East there's already a distributor there that
was also the reason why we've met at Arab Health a year ago so we do have a
distributor and they are also covering all the smaller countries around Dubai
or the United Arab Emirates we also going further further to the East
evaluating distributors in for example on the Philippines, Thailand, India, China
because it's the huge huge markets and they also need robotic scopes that's
obvious of course we're gonna go there and only focusing on on Europe and on
the United States yes and no so my point of view it doesn't make sense for
example if you would just focus on Austria and Germany because then we
would have a product for just these two countries and we would never have the
chance also to to get the feedback and all the procedures done what we need to
do the next steps when we only stay in two countries. Indeed and so let's move
and start talking about the more general industry that's so I understand that
this this isn't an invasive surgical robot but the end is so unique so we're
gonna have to talk about some things that aren't as similar but the actual
surgical robotics industry what do you see as some of the future trends and
what do you think it looks like from a technology perspective? So you mean from
the surgical robotics from that industry what we see is many many projects but
I think what you also see many projects which are invasive getting into
direction of the da Vinci or into direction of the CMR system or like
like also the distal motion and so on there many many more coming up I don't
know all the differences of those systems but that's that's one one
general trend no one can ignore but on the other hand what's what I think is
super exciting because when you talk to someone either in the field or in the
medical device field or also outside the medical device field and you speak about
surgical robotics they always say ah it's the intuitive system okay so that's
that's seems to be the pretty one pretty pretty only one which is which is known
but I think that having more specific robots for specific procedures that's I
think the more interesting part and not just thinking about laparoscopic
surgical robots for example that that robot to insert a cochlear electrode
that's pretty cool also improving improving patients residual hearing
stuff like that or also interventional systems also in Tyrol they're building
one tiny robot for interventional surgical procedures and biopsies stuff
like that is I think also very very interesting and the trend there
definitely it's to analyze the data which is available AI will also be there
or will be will get stronger and stronger to support doctors and also to
support surgical robots. So there's likely going to be people out there who
want to develop their own surgical robotics company they might have the
idea to develop some kind of high-technology products what advice
would you give to someone who's at that early stage working at a company has a
napkin sketch and on the balcony with their friends what advice would you give
to someone like that? I think everything what I say now is just wrong don't do it
no don't be afraid of going that path and plan for not that one extra mile
plan for more extra extra miles but I mean it's a getting more and more
competitive field as we know that there's so many projects in the last
couple or few years got FDA approval got C marked and so on so it's getting more
and more competitive so if someone thinks to move into that direction then
building the next intuitive DaVinci then I think everyone or the one who does it
has to exactly know that the weaknesses of the other devices but I got that's
that's true for every product you're going to develop and when you decide to
go into the direction of developing one super specific robot for one super
specific procedure then you got to involve many surgeons as soon as
possible to evaluate if the idea really makes sense and if it's going to be used
for you know from an audience which is big enough who is also willing to pay
the bills and yeah something like that will be the recommendation if it makes
sense and don't be afraid of going that path it's a lot of fun a lot of pain
cool good stuff and how about people who are looking to enter into the industry
so not not founding their own companies but people looking to enter at maybe an
academic level or moving from the wider medical devices market moving to a high
technology robotic product yeah apply for the jobs come to BHS we got some
opportunities for you that's that's the advice here no I mean you're gonna learn
you're gonna learn on the job anyway it's doesn't matter in what position it
is if it's in the RD department or if it's sales or marketing or else a very
very important job also here at BHS is clinical application because someone
needs to teach how our system or a surgical robot is being used during the
procedure especially in the first cases because it's not obvious how the system
is gonna work and of course the training procedures but still that support is
needed and going going to the direction coming from another field or not from
such a high-tech field just just do it just do it it doesn't make any sense to
be afraid of that high-tech space and it doesn't make any sense being afraid of
surgical robotics I'm sure 100% of the companies out there they do have
excellent training programs so that starting in such a company is I don't
want to say easy but possible. Okay and so how do you feel about being able to
support your plans for the future do you think the talent exists in the market at
the minute are there enough people coming through your pipeline wanting to
join BHS technologies? Yes it's okay it's okay so we do have we do have the MCI
which is a university private university they do have a medical device or a medtech
course and also even previous to that so Innsbruck is not a bad place to recruit
but of course could be more especially on the regulatory affairs side it's not
easy to to hire someone or also to find the right people because you don't want
to have the internal police which is yeah slowing things down that that's
pretty tough but on the developer side also manufacturing if you think about
that that's that's okay with us it seems that we didn't do everything wrong. So
and you mentioned one thing that regulatory affairs and what has been
your regulatory pathway so far and how is you be founded to gain regulatory
clearance? So the pathway was as we had one one former colleague who was taking
care about all of that and as it is just a medical device class one in the EU and
also in the United States our regulatory pathway is pretty easy because we don't
have to do a clinical study and we can outsource the clinical evaluation for
example which is a big effort to put together but that's something we can
outsource and all the other things in validating the product can be done by
developers or test engineers and then as the company is ISO 1345 certified
since the second first year since 2018 we do have all the processes we are
getting the technical file together and compiling all the documents so this this
is for us it's pretty easy to achieve the CE mark and do the 6601 testing
externally according to CB scheme for FDA listing it's also just a
registration of the product and in most of the countries for us it's just
registering the device and then we are there that's a different game for class
2a, b or class 2 devices in the States and entering India or China that's a bit
bigger effort also for class one device so the pathway here is just to work with
a distributor who knows all the details of the regulation of how to submit the
technical file how to do type testing that they all get the context to the two
test houses and so on so that's that's a pathway here and we do only support the
product so that they have all the information they need from the technical
file to submit. Okay and so to close off the podcast for today and what I want to
know is what do you think are the three top technologies and that we're going to
see in the surgical robotics sector in the future? The three top technologies
that's a tough question I didn't think about that just give me a second what
what's going to support in various or for various robots and functionalities
it's it's definitely going to be AI that's that's going to support even if
it's just a part of the of the whole device which is supported by AI. AR
augmented reality that's also a thing which is what we also see and what we
are facing having augmented reality so that you see more get more information
to the into the as we call it the microsurgical cockpit so that also the
surgeon has all the information needed or maybe also a bit more and the third
one is connected devices so that's also something where I'm 100% sure which is
picking up more and more that there is in the future is going to be a maybe a
standard interface or an interface so that you're able to connect various
devices so that again also the devices are able to to collaborate a bit more
than it's just today having side-by-side one and the other device of course they
connected over the PAX system but not in a way that they are
communicating with each other controlling functions and and stuff
like that. Perfect, well thank you very much for joining me today on the podcast
Mike it's been a pleasure to have you and hope you had a good time as well. Sure, sure
thanks for having me Henry, thank you.
