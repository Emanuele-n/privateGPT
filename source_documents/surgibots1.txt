Welcome to the Surgery Bots podcast, the show where we explore the latest
advancements in surgical robotics and how they're transforming healthcare.
Every two weeks we sit down with a guest who is at the forefront of this
incredible space. Surgical robotics is changing the way we approach surgery. Our
guests are going to share their experiences and insights discussing the
challenges they face and successes they've achieved. We'll also delve into
the latest trends and innovations, exploring the newest robotic
technologies and how they're being used to improve patient outcomes. Whether
you're a healthcare professional, a researcher or just interested in the
latest advancements in surgical robotics, this podcast is for you. So join us as we
explore the world of surgical robotics and discover how these cutting-edge
technologies are shaping the future of medicine. On today's episode we have Ben
Sexton of Monogram Orthopaedics. So Monogram is a surgical robotics company
based at Austin, Texas who are looking to disrupt the orthopaedic robotic market
through a combination of high technology and 3D printed implants. Ben
gives us a really raw look under the bonnet of what's gone into building this
surgical robot and getting their system to FDA pre-submission. I really like
Monogram's funding route because it's so unique in the industry and they've
crowdfunded a surgical robot. So without further ado I hope you enjoy this
episode. So hello and welcome to this episode of the Surgibots podcast Ben.
I'd love to see you. I've just done an intro to this episode but for the
sake of the audience, who are you and what do you do? Henry, thank you so much
for having me. I really appreciate the opportunity to share more about what
we're up to. So my name is Ben Sexton. I'm the CEO here at Monogram Orthopaedics.
We're a medical technology company in the orthopaedic space and we're trying
to commercialize a novel robotic system with the intent to try and make more
surgeons use robots because ultimately we think surgeons using robotic
technology, enabling technology, is better for patients. And that's the
mission of Monogram is really ultimately to improve the state-of-the-art in
orthopaedic robotics and enable the next generation of orthopaedic implants which
we believe will be 3D printed and personalized in a way that is really
hard to do without 3D printing and some of the technology that we are trying to
take advantage of. Awesome and what's your background before joining Monogram?
How do you find yourself in this position? Sure, so I'm a former nerd,
still nerd. My background's engineering so I'm a mechanical engineer
and also spent my childhood building things. I've always
liked motors and robots and things that move. Later on after completing
my engineering school I kind of realized that I had some gaps in my knowledge
specifically on really how the world works, which is how companies that
build cool things, how they actually come into being, what's called the finance
side of things. So I went and worked for a hedge fund that helped companies
basically was investing in opportunities and I learned started to learn a lot
about how money kind of moves around the economy and I got a designation that's
called the CFA which is called Chartered Financial Analyst. So it's a lot like
has a lot of similarities to let's say a CPA so I kind of started to understand
how companies accounting works and what to look for in a good business model all
those sorts of things. So I'm an engineer who went to the dark side as I
like to say and also learned enough to be dangerous with finance and my
ultimate vision was always to really be a part of a company that was trying to
do something innovative and Monogram I think is the it's really the perfect
example of that. So how did you come across Monogram? How did you join the
business? Sure, so through my opportunity at the hedge fund I was working at I
met the chairman of a public company that's in the orthopedic space and I
had the opportunity to join them in a business development role really to kind
of the way I kind of characterize it is help help them kind of on untap their
their IP portfolio they had some pretty valuable intellectual property that my
mission was to try and help them to monetize that and their main market was
the orthopedic space and in that position I met a surgeon a very
charismatic surgeon named Dr. Eunice Doug Eunice who's the founder of
Monogram who had started Monogram in 2016 and his vision was to enable
patient-specific 3d printed implants with robotics he he felt like robots
were great but we were just using them to put in the same old generic implants
and so he felt like really the the future of orthopedics is using robots to
really reimagine completely how we do surgery and what implants should look
like and I had been around the orthopedic market enough to really
understand how both how difficult his challenge was going to be because of
just how conservative the market is but also just how serious the opportunity he
was talking about was that there really was a need in our market to change the
paradigm we there's four companies in orthopedics that account for the lion's
share of the market right and that's because this generic business model
makes it very difficult for small companies who have limited capital to
compete really the orthopedic market is a service business for all intents and
purposes there's not a lot of technological differentiation I mean
they would argue with you on that but I certainly there is on the robotic side I
would say but when you look at an orthopedic implant it's pretty hard to
tell the differences between different companies to be honest with you and so
it's all the same bill of materials it's really the same devices that people are
trying to sell and it's all about the service that you ultimately provide the
surgeon we would say and there's a chance that opportunity in orthopedics I
think to change that paradigm with more of a just-in-time inventory model
robotics leaning out the amount of equipment you need in the operating room
being more efficient and so maybe now kind of looking back Doug and I were
both naive enough to believe that we could try and do something and make a
difference and here we are today so I met Doug in 2017 in my role he he needed
help with building some prototypes for the system that he was working on and
we hit it off we quickly became friends and Doug asked me to join his company as
the CEO in 2018 which which I did to to the chagrin of my of my wife yeah who
really is the reason monogram exists today but yeah so I jumped in in 2018
full-time and it's been a incredible journey since then absolutely let's let's
start off talking about the technological side of monogram and help
me understand how the system is unique and what technology is going to disrupt
this market sure so let's let's just kind of back up and just look at the
orthopedic robotic market today so when we talk about orthopedic robotics we're
really talking about one company and that's Stryker so let me say maybe a
little over a decade ago maybe maybe about a decade ago Stryker was was bought
a company a startup called Mako Surgical they were publicly traded doing about a
hundred million in sales and they bought this company and honestly it was a very
gutsy acquisition the company had taken about 20% of the partial knee market in
about three years but there was a lot of skepticism around you know they didn't
have a total knee that they were it was just a niche market partial knees and
there was a lot of pushback you know well surgeons use this what's adoption
gonna look like is this really adding clinical value and Mako was once one
Stryker bought them they basically just been blazing the trail for orthopedic
robotics and today you know it depends on what you where you look for the data
but give or take they have about 90% of the orthopedic market what we look at is
utilization we we really when you look at what technology certain surgeons are
actually using Mako is by far and away the dominant player so that's really our
benchmark for orthopedic robotics is the Mako system the Mako system is a
four-joint arm and what's really unique about it is that the surgeon initiates
the cutting so it's it leverages a technology that Stryker calls haptics
the user grabs the end of end effector of the robot and is responsible for
moving it around within a constrained plane that has boundaries it's an
incredible technology and I we think it adds a tremendous amount of value and we
think it's only the beginning but when you look at utilization in totality of
orthopedic robotics only about 12% of knees today are robotic and so when you
kind of start to peel back the layers and ask yourself why is it that even
though there's this really innovative technology why why aren't surgeons using
it our conclusion from our market analysis is that surgeons really are
under too much pressure to basically produce surgeons have generally speaking
I mean if they're working at an academic institution this might not be the case
but generally speaking they they have a variable top line it really depends on
how much volume they're able to do and so the challenge with robotics is you're
introducing technology that has a longer time to complete the surgery so the in
room out of room operative time for a robotic system can be 30 minutes longer
than a manual surgery so you multiply that by four or five six surgeries a day
it makes it very difficult for a robot for a surgeon to keep their volume with
a robot so what's innovative about the monogram system is we are really every
single meticulous detail has been designed to address how do you make this
surgery faster how do you make it more efficient how do you make it competitive
time competitive with a manual surgery so that there's really no reason for a
surgeon not to use your system right if if your system is theoretically faster
than a manual procedure why wouldn't a surgeon use your technology that's the
ultimate goal and everything we do is is trying to execute that so to do that we
believe that a system has to be really rely on what's good about robotics right
we we think that a surgeon moving the arm around is is very extremely innovative
but you would never go to a factory right with a bunch of CNC operators and
see them moving around the CNC right there's an inherent inefficiency to the
user doing things that can be up that not optimized but doing things that can
be developed offline and made to be faster right robotically so we believe
that ultimately a robot should be actively removing bone and that you can
do that more efficiently over time with a robot that knows what it's supposed to
cut and executes cut paths that are very efficient and you can do it in our
opinion just as safe if not safer because we generally speaking there's
not a whole lot of variability in it in it in a knee replacement you kind of you
know what six cuts need to be made you kind of know where the critical tissues
are so you can make a lot of constraints on the system that help make
it safer but when it comes to what is innovative about the system monogram is
going to be the first robot on the market that is active which means the
surgeon is actually not touching the end effector they're touching a foot pedal
instead and has a a sagittal saw that's attached to it and that is an
incredibly challenging engineering problem that our team was able to solve
I don't know if we want to go down the rabbit hole of why that's so tricky but
we're going to be the first company we think in the world to have this
combination and ultimately the vision is for the system to be very very efficient
over time so we're looking at every incremental part of this robotic
surgical workflow and we're trying to make it more efficient make it easier
ultimately our vision is for and we believe it's possible for robotics to be
faster than manual. Wow that's that's interesting text it sounds like high
levels of automation there how how is that received in the market when the
surgeon not doing the procedure what's the initial feedback being for higher
levels of autonomy compared to the surgeon? Sure so I mean it's at first
blushed right it sounds like higher levels of autonomy but the system is not
autonomous the the surgeon is actually in the loop and has to drive the system
so it's impossible for a robot to do anything without the surgeon when you
kind of start peeling back the layers of safety everything we've done or decided
to do is driven by a safety consideration so let's let's start with
like how the actual user moves the robot so the user route moves our robot
with a foot pedal rather than holding the end effector and the reason for that
is we actually think it's safer right when you when you make the surgeon hold
a piece of technology to use your system you've all you've all already taken away
you know a the hand of somebody who's of extremely highly trained individual
right our system has two free hands our our IFU will likely encourage them to
use retractors to protect critical tissues with both hands they're right
there next to the next to the procedure our setup is designed so that the
surgeons exactly where they would be with a manual knee the way we've
positioned the tracking camera and the robot cart really minimizes occlusion
that we don't have it here in front of us but you know the whole lateral side
of the patient is open the robots always approaching from the medial side of the
knee there's a lot of safety considerations we for example we didn't
want the surgeon to have to turn their back to look at a navigation screen the
navigation screen is always right there in their line of sight but the knees
always right there in their line of sight our vision is that robotics are
enabling and should in no way introduce any kind of as minimally as possible
introducing convenience or potential safety risk then then we we operate very
similar to Mako so Mako has let's call them safety boundaries that they've
designed around each of the six cuts we have the same concept we just introduce
additional layers of safety so we have for example a virtual gate that acts a
lot like a virtual cut guide that constrains the body of the saw we we
also have actual patient bone boundaries that constrain the saw blade in certain
cuts so we really kind of take Mako then in addition it's really
three-dimensionally constrained right so when the saw is executing cut it can
move along a plane and it can also rotate on an axis that's perpendicular
to that plane we take away those degrees of freedom so we have cut paths that
have been predetermined kind of we we know exactly where the robots going to
go we display those to the user and the user can only move forward or back along
those cut paths so generally speaking you know in any robotics when you take
away degrees of freedom when you when you limit the amount of unexpected
behavior that a system can do it's generally helps improve the safety of
the system another thing that we've done as a safety feature is our our system
externally fixates the patient so and it's navigated so that you know the
Mako system is navigated but really relies on the it's a real-time system
and so if the bone moves the robot has to kind of move with it and if there's
any latency there could be you know potentially some risk we don't think we
think it's a minute risk but still it's it's there with our system when the
surgeons ready to cut they externally fixate the patient they're fixed and the
robot is also tracking where the patient is with rigid arrays but what that
allows us to do is if let's say one of those arrays has loosened during cutting
we can we can more easily detect that because we know the patient's externally
fixated so there's just a lot of things where we really said okay what's the
safety threshold let's try and make it even more aggressive in terms of being
safe and a big part of that is you know when we when we have discussions with
the FDA you know their primary focus is how show us that your system is safe so
we really want to be able to show them look like here's why it's safe here's
how you stop the blade here's how the surgeon can do this if there's anything
unexpected and we've really made painstaking efforts to really remediate
or kind of belt and suspenders think about anything that could be a safety
concern so we actually don't think our system is is automated in the sense that
the surgeon is doing everything the robot couldn't just do the surgery the
surgeon has to do it so but yeah that's um that's how we've kind of thought a
lot about the technology and I hope you're so I hope your listeners are
interested because we sometimes we can kind of geek out so apologies if it's
too no and I really like the level of detail on technology to start off with
and you mentioned the FDA there how far along the regulatory path are you at the
moment sure so we we've had our pre-submission meeting with the FDA the
just for those who aren't really familiar the the the pre-submission
meeting is a great opportunity to kind of present your system to the FDA and
get feedback understand how they're thinking about certain things how
they're thinking about you know you you mentioned autonomy how they're thinking
about autonomy how they define autonomy how they define active how they what
what they would like to see around testing what they what they think of the
predicates that we think our system is equivalent to and so it's really a an
opportunity to engage with the FDA about your system so we've had our first
pre-submission meeting as you can imagine our system is pretty complex
right we have a lot of moving parts and it can be challenging to clearly
communicate everything your system does and how it works so with a pre-submission
you you have an opportunity to actually meet with a panel which we did and
presented them via presentation with videos and were able to explain how
certain things work and it was clear that some of the information was new to
them you know that seeing actually seeing us walk through how the system
works so what they requested was that we basically file a supplement to the first
filing that we did that really explains in detail more about the system more
about some of the things that came up during our meeting and kind of
continuing the dialogue so we're actively engaged with the FDA and and
talking to them and their feedback has been really valuable in terms of
understanding the technology and what what they're looking for and when you
expecting this to get to market or do you have a date when you know that
you're looking to launch sure so a lot of that is going to depend on sort of
the FDA in terms of whether or not they have a clinical data request with our
510k submission so that's what the these pre-submission meetings are trying to
establish is you know can we demonstrate that our system is really as safe or
safer than the the predicates that we're claiming substantial equivalents to and
making sure that we can answer that question in a way that's satisfactory so
we so we don't yet know whether or not clinical data will be needed and that
would determine the the actual launch timeline from a commercialization
standpoint so if the FDA wanted clinical data we would expect that to start in
2024 early 2024 and we get a lot of emails from people who are interested in
being subjects in the clinical study you know so we would need to run a run a
clinical trial our expectation is that that would be probably like I don't want
to give too much forecast than that just because we're still in the process of
really making sure we understand that but if there isn't a clinical trial
request and the FDA is satisfied that we can prove that our system is safer safer
than the predicates we expect to be in the market in 2024 fantastic it takes a
lot of money sorry what was that yeah so it takes a lot of money to get a
surgical robot built prototypes built and get it to market you guys have
raised thirty eight million dollars so far and what I really like about monogram
is the crowdfunding piece because it's so unique to surgical robotics and the
first time I've seen it so tell me more about why you decided to go down a
funding crowdfunding route and the process that you had to go through for
that I'm gonna be honest with you Henry you know crowdfunding wasn't our first
choice I'm sure you talked to a lot of entrepreneurs you know we did the same
hit our heads against the wall as many many have before us and many will after
us you know we just struggled to get the capital from a kind of let's say
traditional finance right we you know Doug and I were a one-man two-man band
basically we had a really good idea we had some patent filings we had a
prototype that we could show people did interesting things we had this vision we
would go to meetings and people would say you know yeah that's great where's
your team you know how are you gonna execute this they say come back to us
when you have FDA approval you know we agree with you but you know we have we
completely agree there's nothing flawed about your investment thesis but you
know we just think it's gonna take too much money or it was never objections
that were like hey this is a really bad idea no there's not a business
opportunity here none of that it was always just I would say just the scale
of of what needed to be done and you know building a team and how are you
gonna find the people to do this we just weren't able to raise the capital and I
said Doug what about you know crowdfunding so the first part portal
that we reached out to is a group called seed invest they they've now since been
acquired by a company called start engine who we've also raised with and
we just basically presented the opportunity to the community we got
through their investment committee and we presented to the general public and
said hey you know here's what we're trying to do here's our mission we think
orthopedics can be better than it is do you want to help support it and it
turned into one of the most successful crowdfunded orthopedic raises I'm aware
of and yeah so that's it just snowballs from there and once you're in the
crowdfunding jet stream it's it's very it becomes a blessing and a curse
because it's it's it's a challenge to get out of it and go back to conventional
so we you know kept we've been kind of in this channel and it's been really
really successful I think now what's next for us is it what we can get into
it Henry but we're we're actually I have a planned listing on Nasdaq so we
right now have a series D round that's just went live and that that's
effectively going to be the capital that takes us public and that will be
publicly listed and that's going to put us in a position I think where we can
access let's say institutional capital that's really needed to push this across
the finish line but I'm so you said there's some benefits and there's some
pitfalls with it so what's what's some of the benefits of going down the
crowdfunding route first and then negatives sure so just so you know I
mean I I I'm a little bit of I don't say I'm a contrarian but I I dislike the way
the system operates today right you have it's almost like a popularity
contest with Silicon Valley and there's like certain things that these VCs are
are looking for and a lot of them are arbitrary and really I don't think good
markers of whether or not a company is going to be successful or whether or not
an entrepreneur has the hunger and to make it happen what I like about
crowdfunding is that you're dealing with real people right and if you're genuine
and you tell them hey look here's what we're trying to do you're transparent
you kind of have a pool of people that either want to be a part of it or not
but it's there's not these intangibles about like why is it not why are you not
invested like what's wrong with my business idea you know what what so
that's um that's the positive of it is it's just more real and organic and you
and you present your idea and people either like it or they don't and and it
either resonates or not the challenge with it is that there is something to be
said for you know a cap table that has like right now we have over 20,000
investors right so and the way that it's changed it's changed a little bit but
crowdfunding is pretty new and and when you would go to these funding portals
you know they're they're negotiating on behalf of their investors that are
coming in and they're trying to to do what they think is in the best interest
of those investors but you know they would put investors into let's say a
share class so now you have a share class that has a lot of investors with
voting rights and you then as a company have to kind of manage a cap table that
has a lot of people and let's be honest like a lot of people invested in
monogram they love it but somebody gave us you know $200 three years ago there
they might be following the story but they might not open every email and you
might have in something important like hey you need to vote on this because you
know somebody wants to you know we have this important corporate action that you
need to we need your vote for so it becomes it can become over time
difficult for companies to really manage that and then the other layer is that
let's say you want to go then to an institutional player because the crowd
unless you're like I know the actually the who was it I think the Green Bay
Packers actually crowdfunded and and I know the portal they used and they said
that within like I don't know a couple hours they had raised like 70 million
dollars and something I mean certainly there's a lot of capital available but
you do start to kind of hit the limits with crowdfunding and there does come a
time where it's hard to scale and you need institutional capital right so
Henry for monogram to be successful we're gonna need really serious capital
right because it's just a pretty serious undertaking right and so when
you start to need institutional capital it becomes challenging to get that
capital when you have a corporate structure like your share structure is
you know has all of these investors that need to vote they can they see like okay
well if I'm gonna give monogram or any company this is a hypothetical this
isn't like happening but if I were to give you a hundred million dollars
there's certain things that I need as an investor right but we can't give it to
them because of how the company is structured right so that's what becomes
challenging with crowdfunding is that it can be it can I don't want to say take
you out of the game but make make it extremely difficult for institutional
investors to come alongside and help build what you're doing so a big part of
going public for us is that it's going to convert all of the preferred share
classes that we have into common shares so everybody's kind of on the same level
playing field and then we'll look like any other company for an institutional
investor it's it's I hope that's helpful so I would caution anybody thinking
about crowdfunding you know just be really careful you know for me I always
wanted our shareholders to have voting rights because I felt like hey they're
a part of this right I I want our investors to to be able to vote on
things if they if they don't think the company is doing what it needs to do I
want them to have a voice the challenge is that it's it could become an
impediment like it can almost hurt them because then when you're trying to get
let's say an institutional investor to come in whose capital would help make
their investment more accretive they look at that and go oh well I don't like
that and it's it's so now I think we're going to be hopefully in a better
position once we once we are public. Have you been approached by investors
whether that's from large institutional med techs or venture capital or anyone
have you been approached about an interest in monogram? Yes certainly so
we I mean we always are having those discussions I wouldn't be doing my job
if we if we weren't right there's also like something important about timing
right you know you in med tech there's a couple of very accretive I would say
milestones for any startup right so so when you first start out and you're just
a napkin sketch and maybe you have like a couple of patent filings I mean you
don't even have any issued patents you just have some ideas that you put down
on paper maybe you have like one level of value right and then you you can show
that your products pretty cool with a with a prototype and you can maybe do
some some demos maybe that gets you to another level of value in med tech when
you start to get into what's called like verification and validation which is
here's how my product that's going to be commercialized actually works and I can
do right now if you ask me to you know a hundred perfect knees and there's not a
single kink in my system and this is what is going to be on the market I'm
just proving that it's safe and effective you know when you start to get
to that level that's another level of value and then if you get all of the
regulatory uncertainty out of the way you know is it a clinical trial is it
not what is a clinical trial look like do you have the funding for it yes or
no all of those sorts of things that it's like another level of value right
and then ultimately if you once you're approved it's another level of value so
a lot of these companies are very busy and they are not incentivized to take
risk and this is what I would caution any sort of let's say startup CEO trying
to raise capital desperate for capital you know these companies are not
incentivized to take risk it's so you can spend a lot of effort spinning your
wheels showing them something that's a really really cool idea it might even be
flushed out but you can waste a lot of time I mean Henry in q4 of last year I
thought we were going to do a deal and that didn't materialize and it was a lot
of time wasted a lot of time wasted and it really had nothing ultimately to do
with with us it was just the market changed and you know these companies are
very risk averse so that's really the thing I would just caution is bring
people in at the right time if you can if you if you can wait so that's what
really what we've tried to do is is make sure that we aren't pushing things before
they're ready so I think now we're getting to a very interesting point for
monogram where we're getting into V&V soon so we anticipate we'll be in
verification validation soon and and then it really is like here's our
product we know it's gonna you don't go into verification validation wondering
if your product is going to pass right it's it's not like a mystery whether or
not you're going to get through the testing you need to do so then it really
I think makes more sense to try and figure out what a what a go-to-market
strategy looks like with various players and risk appetites change and to be
honest with you Henry I think that Mako is going to continue to be the superior
technology and the longer with the more time that goes by the better because
while other companies in the space have released made efforts to try and compete
we think that it's just a matter of time before people realize that the
solution is a Mako like solution right the innovation is cutting I think that's
where a lot of orthopedic robotic companies have missed it the innovation
is cutting the innovation is not navigation you know the innovation is
efficient cutting like putting the cutting tool where it needs to go and
removing that bone in an efficient way that's ultimately the innovation of
robotics and I think a lot of companies have missed that and another trend that
I think is going to be potentially devastating is what Stryker calls
functional alignment or kinematic alignment we think that you know
robotics are changing how surgery is done and really forcing us to question
what the perfect target is I don't have the answer for what the perfect target
is but if the perfect target isn't a mechanically aligned knee then a lot of
these imageless solutions that cut you know the tibia first it's going to be
challenging for them is our opinion so we think we think the market is going to
potentially change very quickly under their feet and we think you need a CT
based solution to address where the market's going so we we think that's
okay for monogram right the more pain the better is our opinion so but we're
doing our best I mean we we certainly would would love to have somebody help
us kind of carry the load of how to go to market we we're certainly not arrogant
about how challenging it is we're here today Henry because because ultimately
nobody bought us right or gave us serious money so we've been forced to
build that build out of necessity and we've always tried to do the right thing
for our investors right we we think that what we've developed has an inherent
value and we we want to make sure that our investors get what we think it's
worth and so we'll see where that goes absolutely so I know that we had a
little chat before this is sitting down recording this podcast and you talked
about a couple of the challenges you've had both when you were demoing the
system on the live stream and demoing the system so and talk to us about when
things go wrong I mean that's really I mean Henry that's why I was saying
cautioning anybody who's like has a especially a medtech solution you you
know be careful about when you show things to people we we had a demo in
2019 for a major strategic and it was just we we just were not ready right I
mean we had a team of three people it was me it was Doug and one other
engineer and then we had an intern and I think I you know anything that could
have gone wrong in this demo went wrong you know and it's because which we have
four people trying to do way way too much and you have to do that as an
entrepreneur right you have to try and push the envelope and you you take
certain risks and this demo did not go well and the strategic has you know
never been back in our building not not to say they won't ever come back but
just a caution I mean these people are busy and a lot of times you don't have
the opportunity to say oh sorry that normally doesn't happen right so you
just have to be careful and make sure that whatever you show them it's it's
ready to go and gonna make it a really strong impression I would say that on
the flip side Henry so monogram has been crowdfunded right since since almost the
beginning so we did raise convertible notes from friends and family and that's
what we use to conduct some studies with UCLA and University of Nebraska to kind
of really put some data around why we thought we had a compelling technology
but since then it's been crowdfunded and when you're crowdfunding so I just would
say I don't actually run all of the marketing I don't have time to to write
every single piece of communication that goes out and so this is for any
entrepreneur right there's there's a there's a process where you hand things
over to somebody else right and you do your best and you my job is really to
try and build technology in a company and some of the marketing that goes out
is not my my voice let's say and so what can happen over time is people think
that you're just sort of you don't say promotional but crowdfunding requires
kind of beating the drum and trying to get people excited right and that's
really counter to the whole management team at monogram with it's not our
personalities inherently is so we had a lot of people who really questioned like
does monogram have anything real or they just a PowerPoint presentation and some
like highly edited videos so I told the team I said guys we owe it to our
community to do a live demo and show them what we're doing and you know with
a live demo that is completely live it's unedited there's no let's cut to a
commercial break and hope this works out and we actually had people that were I
explicitly remember somebody he would he's a also in your medtech market
saying like this is gonna be a huge dumpster fire these guys are a joke you
know who's ready to watch this like go up in flames blah blah and we did this
and basically it was a flawless surgery right we had an end-effector break live
on our air we had to swap it out but you know it was obvious that okay maybe
there's some things they need to be flushed out but these guys have actually
taken this money to build something unique and I would say for any and I'm
telling you nobody everybody was sort of nervous about this I this is not what
medtech does right you you're conservative here and so I follow your
instincts as an entrepreneur and be willing to take risks so I'm gonna speak
against myself and say you know don't demo a system until it's ready but at
some point you have to take some risks and go for it and and I think that
really paid off in terms of showing our investor community that we're actually
genuinely trying to build something we have no guarantees that this is going to
work but here's what we've been trying to do with your money and you genuinely
believe in this mission and so we're actually Henry gonna do another one this
Tuesday I'll give you a link if you go to a monograms website monogram
orthopedics comm we're gonna do another live surgery this coming Tuesday and
it's gonna be awesome that's all I'm gonna say it's it's gonna be even better
than the last one and it's gonna it's gonna have some very unique twists that
I think are going to showcase where technology might go in the future so we
have to keep up now it seems like we're gonna have like an annual trend maybe
once a year I I forced the team to do a live stream and lose sleep for a couple
weeks so this live stream is this to help with the crowdfunding round that
you've just opened yes yes but not only that it's also for people who are already
in who aren't planning on investing like what do you guys what have you been
developing with with our money right it's sort of like accountability to our
shareholders and I can write down on a piece of paper hey here's what we worked
on this is more like here we're gonna show you what we worked on we're going
to show you what's been developed over the past 12 months it's fun Doug hates
these he you know he dug is a conservative surgeon he he doesn't sleep
for like days before they go but I think I think it's the only way to be
authentic and honest with our community and here's what we're trying to do we're
not editing we're not we're open and transparent here here's here's where we
are and let's let the chips fall where they fall kind of thing so pretty
excited about this one though Henry it's gonna be it's gonna be very cool I I can
say this I don't think anybody in orthopedics has done anything like what
we're about to do okay that's that's exciting I was going to tune in anyway
so you've just given even more reason for us to turn on the screens and I'll
share that link with everyone who's listening to the pod and we'll drive
some people to it so I'm looking forward to that and how many people in your last
live stream so you know I don't want to misspeak okay so we had about I think it
peaked oh maybe close to like 2,000 people we had two different streams but
then it was on YouTube and within a very short period it was at like over 10,000
views and then our IP attorney said like take this down immediately even though I
don't think anybody thing was there that we hadn't protected he was just
uptight about it so I think it could have gotten a lot of views if we just
kind of left it there I think this one has the potential to get more views I'll
just say that have you had a chat with your IP attorney this time yeah well
this one this one the plan is not to remove it I'll just say that the plan is
you know it's tough as a startup I'm sure you have entrepreneurs you talked
to who deal with this is like filing a patent is so expensive it's so expensive
I mean to really take a patent through the whole process it's easily 50,000
could even be a hundred thousand I mean when investors ask us like where is the
money going you know you have imagine a portfolio of 20 patents we have another
we could easily file another it's a lot more it's just you have to try and
balance like okay you know we can't protect like we don't want to spend
money on this little screw we really need to focus on our money on where's
the best things to protect but yeah so I think we're good on this one so what's
next for monogram then you've got live show and FDA meetings going public
what's what's the next few things on the horizon for monogram and what's the big
goals my my big goal Henry is you know as we start to turn our sights on
commercialization right so so everything we've been doing has been about
leveraging technology and innovation we're never going to drop that mantle
that is our North Star we have some things that we're developing that are
very exciting we're our vision right so when you look at surgical robotics
there's basically six steps that every surgical robot has to follow we're
scrutinizing all of those steps to see does it have to be done this way so
that's the first thing is just continuing R&D and the next gen so the
second gen monogram system we want to be truly revolutionary that's our goal is
not to stop here but but to continue pushing it this is one thing that I
think a lot of people lose sight of what's on the market today in orthopedic
robotics is the first gen solution it's not even the second gen solution right
it's the first generation so what monograms working on right now we think
is the second generation but there's a third and a fourth generation right so
really that's step one is that's our North Star we're also working on
additional clinical applications so we're working on a partial knee and the
partial knee will have a press fit implant that will be 3d printed and
leverage monogram technology so we think that there's an obvious opportunity for
a press fit partial knee combined with a robot that's to us a no-brainer so
that's the development front but in terms of commercialization right I would
say we we really need to think about how do are we going to take this to market
and grow it and that's really going to be a question of access to capital and
like you asked about have you been approached by VCS or others it's really
going to come down to the funding that we have access to to try and push this
and that's right now like a an uncertainty right so I would say to our
investors with who say you know why do you guys need more money we need more
money because if we're going to grow a company it's going to take a lot of
money so I I always tell people how much like to expect us to have to raise
constantly and a lot so that's going to be our focus is really trying to
understand trying to secure the capital we would need to actually launch and if
that means a development partner or somebody who's already established who
has distribution globally you know maybe that's the way we would go if that
doesn't wouldn't materialize then it would be finding you know growth equity
to try and make it happen so we're we're right now our filter is just what is in
the best interest of shareholders and what are the opportunities we have and
evaluating all of them and trying to decide and just that was about the
capital piece are you worried about the changing market conditions are you
worried about the economy in the future and your ability to access capital if
the markets dive yes so Henry I frequently don't sleep thinking about
that you know no entrepreneur should there's no guarantees you'll have access
to capital and yeah the economy certainly concerns us we've been tried
to be as conservative as we can with hiring and we have so much work to do
and you know it's really hard to find the right balance between keeping your
team lean and getting things done that need to get done but yeah that's a major
that's a major concern right is what what's gonna happen with our with our
economy or the stock market or appetite for risk all we can do Henry is put one
foot in front of the other and try and build a solution that will make a
difference for patients like that is everything we focus on is how is this
thing this system this concept going to ultimately make a surgeon's life easier
or improve outcomes for a patient that's all we think about and that's all
we have in our control to worry about right so if the economy doesn't go where
we want it to go we have to be smart about trying not to spend money on you
know people who we don't necessarily need to hire right now so so for example
you know I get pinged all the time by people who want to be like let's say a
VP of sales or and it's just we're not every dollar that goes into R&D is is
more creative for us right now right every every dollar that goes into
building a product like that's our focus so we it's always a catch-22 but yeah so
we're I would say we're cautious right now I certainly think that things gonna
get tight I will say that it's not all negative though you've seen this Henry
hiring has been challenging the past three to six months right what junior
engineers expectations were let's say for for compensation I think had become
completely unreasonable and that was a negative inflation was real I mean is
real we were seeing it in our in our efforts to try and hire engineers is it
was becoming cost prohibitive so it kind of naturally choked off for us like
access to talent in a way hope hopefully if there was a recession or you know
softening that would improve the labor pool for companies like monogram and but
yeah it's tough it's it's hard to have everything you want there's definitely
signs of the market taking it to a dive I know that J&J unfortunately have just
done a layoff over in their robotics division by the sounds of it and from
the messages I've received and there's other companies as well that are letting
go some really strong talent I think there is a market correction but it's
not necessarily just to do with the markets some of the businesses had poor
fundamentals anyway and so this there are companies still hiring monogram is
still looking for people there's companies all around the world in
surgical robotics you have open engineering positions but it's just a
struggle the market conditions just being blamed for it one thing that's a
little unfortunate and I you know with our space right is you have all of these
really smart engineers that are getting laid off and you and I see them and the
problem is that with our industry and I think it's a disservice to patients and
I think it's a disservice to our industry is they have these onerous
non-competes that get you know nine times out of ten you'll find somebody
who worked at one of these companies and they can't they're not employable
because they have a non-compete and I think that's unfortunate I hope that I
hope that that sort of softens a little bit over time I don't I don't know if it
will but it makes it difficult for companies like monogram to hire people
who can help us build and ultimately the ones who suffer is technology suffers
patients suffer you know when when people who have a lot of experience
can't work because of non-competes that's one thing we've struggled with
we've seen a lot of really really good candidates that we just can't hire
because we don't want to violate those so hmm yeah you can end up in hot
water if you break non-competes but California's where they where they don't
exist and that's where the engineers are most expensive as well yeah so I
guess we've well I don't know I don't know the recommendation is for an
engineer but I mean I'm sure you've seen you've you've said this Henry candidates
that this happens to you all the time I must be incredibly frustrating as a
recruiter yeah yeah I am yeah it is incredibly frustrating and that's all I
really have to say on the matter and it is frustrating and you can't come up
with creative solutions for the right engineers and if the company really does
want to get that engineer then we can work at solutions to kind of dodge the
non-compete and with layoffs usually you are more released from the non-compete
than if you were being headhunted directly and so it very much is a
situational situational thing with non-competes
we'll do is we'll actually talk ping you know that the folks we know do a
courtesy check hey this person's looks like they were laid off are you okay if
we hire them good and so just to close off the podcast and this is gonna be the
theme for my final questions here I want to look to the future paint me a picture
in your eyes and of your vision what is the future of surgical robotics what is
the future of surgical robotics so I think in the next 10 years more surgeons
than not will be using a robot so I think that surgeons who don't use robots
will be in the minority and that it will be come over time viewed as basically a
disservice to your patients if you aren't using one I think we're gonna get
to that point I think we're like in a if you look at partial knees I think about
40% of partial knees are robotic don't don't quote me on that that's a number I
have in my head it might be more or less but I think it's around that level and I
think that's I think we're gonna see the same thing happen in total knees and
then ultimately in other areas and I think what it's gonna take is certain
robots being just easier and faster and more convenient to use so I do that's my
vision and I think that the reason that's important is because these tools
are enabling tools that help surgeons do surgery better I think that's that's at
least our view and we think that that will be more and more substantiated as
surgeons start to question what the optimal target is for a total knee
replacement so if we're just having all of our knees mechanically aligned 10
years from now which I don't think they will be then maybe I'll be completely
wrong but if the market moves to more functional alignment kinematic alignment
personalized alignment whatever you want to call it and if the market really does
move towards more if personalized implants are substantiated with data I
think that robots are really going to start to carry the day perfect thank you
very much for sitting down with me today Ben and for one of the first episodes of
the surgery box podcast it's been an absolute pleasure and thank you very
much anytime Henry thanks for thanks for everything appreciate it it was great
chatting with you
